Dear Manager,

An urgent call with caller ID {{callerid}} was received on {{timestamp|date:'l, F d, Y'}} at {{timestamp|date:'h:i A'}}, at which time nobody was defined as being on-call.

Ordinarily, we would have used your last on-call user, but it appears that nobody has ever been on call (or that all old on-calls have been deleted). As a result, the call could not be handled.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, and encourage you to contact us at support@mdcom.com with the following data
    {{callsid}}
    {{timestamp}}
and we will be happy to assist you in any way we can.

Best,
DoctorCom Staff
