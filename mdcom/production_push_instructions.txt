-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Objective:

The objective of this file is to better document the process required to push
changes from trunk into production with minimum downtime. 

Instructions:
-----
Simply update the below instructions as necessary (e.g., including SQL if it
won't work in alters.sql) so that the person pushing the code out to production
knows what needs to be done to smoothly apply changes.

2013-07-28: KurtV, these steps must be done for integration.  For production do this
    now and incrementally, for qa/devl can be done now or when rm #2074 merged:

    1. Activate your virtual enviroment if not already in:
       $ source /the/path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate
    2. backup database:
        $ mysqldump your_db_name > some_output_file.sql
    3. $ python manage.py syncdb
    4. $ python manage.py create_resetkeys <admin password>
    5. $ python manage.py create_userkeys
    6. $ python manage.py migrate_objectkeys <admin password>
    7. $ python manage.py test
    
    For production run all steps then periodically run steps 5, 6 before 
    final deployment of rm #2074, currently set for staging_1.69.00 release.
